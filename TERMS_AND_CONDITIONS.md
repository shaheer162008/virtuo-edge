# NEXILER TECH - TERMS & CONDITIONS

**Effective Date:** December 2024

---

## 1. PAYMENT TERMS

### 1.1 Upfront Payment
**50% upfront payment is MANDATORY before project commencement.** No work will be initiated without receiving the upfront payment. This payment secures your project slot and covers initial setup and planning costs.

### 1.2 Monthly Services
For ongoing monthly services (retainers, maintenance, subscriptions), **100% advance payment** is required before the service month begins.

### 1.3 Non-Refundable Upfront Payment
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The upfront payment (50% or 100% as applicable) is **NON-REFUNDABLE** once paid. This policy applies regardless of project cancellation by the client, as resources and time slots are allocated upon payment receipt.

### 1.4 Final Payment
The remaining 50% balance for project-based work is due upon project completion and before final delivery of assets/access.

---

## 2. CLIENT COMMUNICATION & PROJECT CANCELLATION

### 2.1 Required Response Time
After upfront payment, if the client does not respond or provide necessary information to proceed with the project, the following procedure will be followed:

- **Day 7:** First follow-up communication sent
- **Day 8:** Second follow-up communication sent (24 hours after first)
- **Day 9:** Third and final follow-up communication sent (24 hours after second)

### 2.2 Automatic Contract Cancellation
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** If the client fails to respond to all three follow-up communications within the specified timeframe, **the contract will be automatically cancelled**. The upfront payment will be retained by Nexiler Tech as per our non-refundable policy.

**2.2.1 Forfeiture & Waiver upon Non-Response:**
- Upon automatic cancellation as described above, Nexiler Tech will document all contact attempts (email, phone, WhatsApp, and any client-portal messages) as part of our records.
- If no contact is established after the three follow-ups, the upfront payment shall be considered **forfeited** and **non-refundable**. By paying the upfront amount, the client expressly agrees that, in the event of non-response leading to automatic cancellation, they irrevocably waive any right to demand a refund, to require Nexiler Tech to resume the cancelled work under the original terms, or to claim damages or additional deliverables related to that cancelled engagement.
- If the client later re-establishes contact and requests to resume the project, Nexiler Tech may, at its sole discretion, offer to restart the project under a new agreement which may require a new upfront payment and revised timeline; any such restart is not an obligation and is subject to availability.


### 2.3 Client Responsibilities
Clients are expected to:
- Respond to communications within 48 hours
- Provide timely feedback and approvals
- Supply necessary assets, content, and information as requested
- Maintain regular communication throughout the project lifecycle

---

## 3. RESULTS GUARANTEE & CLIENT SUPPORT

### 3.1 Our Performance Commitment
✅ **For business growth services** (marketing, SEO, advertising campaigns, etc.), Nexiler Tech commits to delivering measurable results as outlined in your project proposal.

### 3.2 If Results Are Not Achieved
In the event that we are unable to deliver the promised results:
- You will only be charged for actual **setup costs** and third-party expenses incurred
- Our **service fees will be waived entirely**
- We will provide **continued support at no additional cost** until results are achieved

### 3.3 Extended Support Policy
💡 **OUR GUARANTEE:** If results are not met within the initial timeframe, **Nexiler Tech will continue working with you** without charging additional service fees until the agreed-upon results are delivered. You will only pay for any additional third-party costs (ads spend, tools, etc.) if applicable.

### 3.4 Results Definition
Results are defined in your specific project proposal and may include metrics such as:
- Website traffic increases
- Lead generation targets
- Conversion rate improvements
- Search engine rankings
- Social media engagement metrics
- Revenue growth targets

**Note:** Specific KPIs and success metrics will be clearly documented in your project agreement.

### 3.5 Business Growth Package — Terms

The following terms apply specifically to our Business Growth Packages (marketing, advertising, growth engineering, AI-enabled workflows, and related services):

- **Proposal & Acceptance:** After an initial consultation, Nexiler will provide a detailed proposal outlining scope, deliverables, timelines, and pricing. The proposal will include either an upfront invoice or a monthly billing option depending on the selected package. Work will only commence after the client accepts the proposal and the required payment is received.

- **Invoice & Payment Start:** Upon proposal acceptance Nexiler will issue the agreed invoice. For project-based packages, an upfront payment (as stated in Section 1) must be received before work begins. For monthly retainers, the first payment becomes due immediately upon acceptance and must be paid before services start.

- **Daily Updates & Communication:** While active work is being performed, Nexiler will provide regular progress updates. By default, clients on Business Growth Packages will receive daily briefings during active campaign/setup phases; frequency may be adjusted by mutual agreement and will be documented in the proposal.

- **Long-Term Ongoing Support & Charges:** Long-term or ongoing support beyond the initial engagement is charged separately. Ongoing support typically combines a one-time setup or onboarding fee and a recurring maintenance fee (monthly or annual, per client selection). Examples of separately charged items include AI workflow development, third-party API integrations, dedicated integrations, or specialized tooling — these costs (one-time setup + recurring maintenance) may be invoiced together or separately as outlined in the proposal.

- **Re-starts after Cancellation or Non-Response:** If a contract is cancelled due to client non-response (see Section 2.2), and the client later requests to resume services, Nexiler may offer a restart under a new agreement which will generally require a new upfront payment and may include revised pricing and timelines.

- **Scope Changes & Additional Work:** Any requests beyond the agreed scope (including additional channels, new AI workflows, or expanded deliverables) will require a change order and associated fees. Ongoing, ad-hoc or bespoke services are subject to separate pricing.

- **Billing Options & Terms:** Maintenance and support may be billed monthly or annually; exact billing schedule and renewal terms will be specified in the proposal and invoice. Non-payment or disputed invoices will be handled per the Payment Terms in Section 1 and may result in suspension of services.
